This project presents a system that improves retail automation by using computer vision to detect barcodes and expiration dates on products.
The system combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with deep learning models to accurately identify text and barcodes from images, even when conditions like lighting or camera angles vary.
The goal is to reduce manual effort in product tracking and inventory management.
By testing the system with real-world images, the study shows that it can operate in real-time and achieve reliable performance, making it a useful tool for modern retail environments.
